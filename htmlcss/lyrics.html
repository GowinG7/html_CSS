        <p>
            I walked across an empty land
            I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
            I felt the earth beneath my feet
            Sat by the river and it made me complete
            Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
            I'm gettin' old, and I need something to rely on
            So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
            I'm gettin' tired, and I need somewhere to begin
            I came across a fallen tree

            I felt the branches of it looking at me
            Is this the place we used to love?
            Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
            Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
  </p>

            I'm gettin' old, and I need something to rely on
            So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
            I'm gettin' tired, and I need somewhere to begin
            And if you have a minute, why don't we go
            Talk about it somewhere only we know?
            This could be the end of everything
            So, why don't we go

            Somewhere only we know?
            Somewhere only we know
            Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
            I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
            So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
            I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
            And if you have a minute, why don't we go
            Talk about it somewhere only we know?
            This could be the end of everything

            So, why don't we go?
            So, why don't we go?

            Ooh, hey, hey
            Oh-oh-oh

            This could be the end of everything
            So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
            Somewhere only we know
            Somewhere only we knowS
